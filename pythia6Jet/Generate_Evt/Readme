This is to generated PYTHIA6 with STAR tune

/star/data01/pwg/nihar/Pythia6_Htrieg

- this setup only run on rcas

- copy whole directory (/star/data01/pwg/nihar/Pythia6_Htrieg) to your place

There are following files and directories

1)  StRoot/ : you don't need to change anything

2) dijet_rootfiles/ : directory where all the generated Pythia6 root files will be generared 

3) RunPythia_QCDjetsProcess.C  : this is the main runing macro that calls all  Pythia6  functions and generates  events
                  - all the arguments can be found there

4) Execute.sh         :  This shell script runs "RunPythia_QCDjetsProcess.C"
                         command line to run:  
                            $ ./Execute.sh (number)

5) submitJob_gamma.sh : This shell script runs "Execute.sh" which is for many root files from job=by-job auto submission. It can generat at a time 10 root files
                        command line to run:
      			    $ ./submitJob_gamma.sh

How to RUN this __________________

step 1)  after coping to your area
step 2) change your directory path in "RunPythia_QCDjetsProcess.C" at line number#10

step 3) make "cons"

step 4) once your directory path is set and "cons" successfull; following 

$ nohup ./submitJob_gamma.sh >& see.log &

Note: Each time you submit (step-4) you need to change "val" in submitJob_gamma.sh, otherwise root files will be overwritten
