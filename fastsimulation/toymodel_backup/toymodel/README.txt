This is the Toymodel Monte Carlo Jet generator.
Originaly  developped by Gabriel Barros.

Subdirectories:

"Production"
Main code to produce heavy ion events with jets (single particle, PYTHIA jets,..).
It can also produce empty events with PYTHIA jets with detector effects which are used for detector response matrix.

"Analysis"
Code to create and save histograms.

"Unfolding"
For creating response matrices in format which can be used with ROOUnfold

"macros"
macros for running the analysis

"submitter"
macros for job submitting

"modules"
module files (loaded with "module" command) to setup paths and othe system variables
